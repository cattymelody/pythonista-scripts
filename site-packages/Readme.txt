This directory is included in the default import path, so that you can put reusable modules here.

Please note that site packages will *not* be reloaded automatically when you run a script. This is different from modules in other user directories, so you should typically only put modules here that you don't intend to change.

If you create a file named `pythonista_startup.py` in this directory, it will automatically be executed when you launch Pythonista.
